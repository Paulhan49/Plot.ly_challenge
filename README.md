BubbleChart: Based on the sample chosen in dropdown, the sample values and IDs are reviewed and scaled by bubble size.

Demographic Field Box: details the fields of the metadata JSON based on the chosen ID in the dropdown.

Technology/Framework (In order):
VS Code Editor: HTML (bootstrap). Javascript. Within Javascript: D3, Plot.ly. When reviewing the index.html file, needed to review by accessing http.server.
